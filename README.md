# Vaccine-Preserving-System
The Vaccine Preservation System ensures safe storage and transport of vaccines by maintaining optimal temperature conditions, preventing spoilage and potency loss. Using advanced cooling, monitoring, and backup power, it supports reliable immunization programs, especially in remote and resource-limited areas. 

Portable Vaccine Preservation and Monitoring System
📌 Project Overview
The Portable Vaccine Preservation and Monitoring System ensures safe storage and transport of vaccines by maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels. It is designed for remote healthcare facilities, mobile vaccination units, and vaccine distribution centers. The system integrates real-time monitoring, alerts, and portability, ensuring vaccines remain effective during transit and in areas lacking stable refrigeration.

🎯 Problem Statement
Maintaining vaccines at the correct temperature during storage and transport is critical to ensure their efficacy. Traditional refrigeration units are often bulky, power-dependent, and lack real-time monitoring. This project addresses these challenges by providing a portable, IoT-enabled solution.
